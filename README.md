# chrome-app
Chrome app for the BitLox hardware wallet

Build with node v5.1.0
Note: current Angular versions have a bug with packaged Chrome apps.
Manually download and replace the angular components in bower_components (after npm install and bower install) with the most recent version (v1.5.10-build.5179 as of this writing)
Modules angular, angular-animate, and angular-sanitize were replaced.
